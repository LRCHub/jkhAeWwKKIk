[00:13.03] I'm still a fan even though I was salty
[00:15.03] Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
[00:17.90] Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
[00:20.54] I'm so mature, I'm so mature
[00:23.43] I'm so mature I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
[00:26.63] I don't want none, I just want you
[00:29.03] If I can't have you, no one should
[00:31.79] I might
[00:33.42] I might kill my ex
[00:36.08] Not the best idea
[00:38.52] His new girlfriend's next
[00:40.74] How'd I get here?
[00:44.16] I might kill my ex
[00:46.84] I still love him though
[00:49.52] Rather be in jail than alone
[00:54.64] I get the sense that it's a lost cause
[00:57.00] I get the sense that you might really love her
[00:59.25] The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
[01:01.63] I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion
[01:04.16] But damn, you was out of reach
[01:06.42] You was at the farmers market with your perfect peach
[01:09.11] Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
[01:11.77] Now you layin' facedown, got me sayin', "R-I-P"
[01:14.56] I'm so mature, I'm so mature
[01:17.27] I'm so mature I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
[01:20.45] I don't want none, I just want you
[01:22.92] If I can't have you, no one will (I might)
[01:27.25] I might kill my ex
[01:29.96] Not the best idea
[01:32.61] His new girlfriend's next
[01:34.54] How'd I get here?
[01:38.02] I might kill my ex
[01:40.65] I still love him though
[01:43.43] Rather be in jail than alone
[01:48.62] I did it all for love (love)
[01:51.16] I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
[01:53.85] I did all of this sober
[01:56.50] I did it all for us, oh
[01:59.35] I did it all for love (love)
[02:01.60] I did all of this on no drugs (drugs)
[02:04.55] I did all of this sober
[02:06.74] Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)
[02:09.03] Oh
[02:10.41] I just killed my ex
[02:12.98] Not the best idea (idea)
[02:15.72] Killed his girlfriend next
[02:17.87] How'd I get here?
[02:21.16] I just killed my ex
[02:23.92] I still love him though (I do)
[02:26.59] Rather be in hell than alone
